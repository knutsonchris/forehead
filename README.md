# forehead

implementation of a charades game in flutter

### how to play

pick a category

place the phone on your forehead

have your friends try to explain the word on the screen without saying the word

if you guess correctly, tilt the screen towards the floor to move on to the next word

if you are stumped, tilt the screen towards the ceiling to skip the word

you have 60 seconds to guess as many words as possible



### notes

was written as fast as possible so that we wouldn't have to pay for an already existing app

just about every widget size was designed for a 6.5" iphone, will likely look strange on different screen sizes
